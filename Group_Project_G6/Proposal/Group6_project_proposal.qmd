## Project Overview

### Topic Selection & Introduction

With the given choices based on the VAST Challenge 2024 and CHINAVIS 2024 Data Visualisation Competition, the selected topic for this group project is Challenge I from the latter, titled「Data Analysis Inspires Wisdom」Time-Series Multivariate Education Data Visual Analytics Challenge . This topic was chosen due to the to the Project Group members' contextual familiarity with the topic, as well as its alignment the members' learning interests in leveraging on key visual analytics tools, to explore and design data-driven solutions for seemingly complex problems.

The selected project is centred on the learning patterns of learners in a programming course conducted by NorthClass Education Training Institute. Fundamentally, the project's raison d'etre is to provide actionable insights towards the institution's endeavor to diagnose and analyze learners' knowledge mastery levels, monitor the trends in their learning behaviors, identify and dissect potential factors that contribute to learning difficulties, and hence to derive feasible suggestions to adjust teaching strategies and course design.

To this end, data was collected from a select group of learners over a specified set of programming tasks over a particular learning period to facilitate the design and implementation of a Visual Analytics solution as a key outcome in this project.

### Problem Statement & Requirements

From the Challenge, the key problem statement was to perform a comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets that describe various aspects of the learner's profile, learning patterns and status, to derive key insights to enhance teaching strategies and course design.

Consequently the key requirements based on the 5 stipulated tasks in the challenges were as follows.

-   Task 1: To provide a quantitative assessment of the learners' knowledge mastery and identify weak links in their knowledge system, based on the multi-dimensional attributes such as answer scores and answer status in the learners' log records of the learners' question-answering behaviors.
    -   This would entail an analysis of the learners' aggregate performance in their programming tasks (a.k.a. questions in the dataset), including measures of central tendency, or any notable patterns that can glean insights towards knowledge mastery and weaknesses from the given datasets
-   Task 2: To design and present learners' profiles, based on learners' personalized learning behavior patterns (including peak answering hours, preferred question types, correct answering rates, etc.), and various other attributes and characteristics
    -   This would entail an analysis and profiling of of learners' behaviours and attributes based on statistically significant patterns that are observed across the variables in the given datasets
-   Task 3: To analyse and provide a visual representation of the relationship between learning modes and knowledge acquisition (learners' ability to absorb, integrate, and apply knowledge)
    -   This would entail an analysis to uncover the various learning modes and the patterns and/or correlations that it may have with the learners' performance in the questions from the given datasets
-   Task 4: To analyse the difficulty level of questions and learner's level of knowledge (which should mostly align) and also to identify 'inappropriate questions' that may not align to this relationship.
    -   This would entail an analysis and comparison between the learners' performance in each question and the learners' performance ranking, and hence to identify any potential outliers that violate the alignment of question difficulty and learner's level of knowledge
-   Task 5: To offer valuable recommendations to optimize question bank content settings and enhance the quality of teaching and learning, based on the outcomes of the aforementioned analysis of Tasks 1 to 4 above.
    -   This would entail deriving actionable recommendations based on the insights gleaned in the visual analytics of the datasets from tasks 1 to 4 above

## The Dataset

The provided materials for included 3 datasets described below, as well as a data description document

-   Dataset 1: Student Information - This comprises of 5 Cols, 1364 Rows, providing individualised demographic variables of the learners (a.k.a students) within the scope this project
-   Dataset 2: Learning Subject Title Information - This comprises of 5 Cols, 44 Rows, providing variables of the questions from the programming tasks which are collated in the scope of this project
-   Dataset 3: Class Submission Records - This comprises of multiple datasets, each with 10 Cols and various number of rows, providing supposedly the participating learners' answering variables to the questions collated in the scope of this project

## Approach

## Methodology

Our methodology systematically integrates data collection, data processing, analysis, pattern mining, modeling, and recommendation to create a comprehensive Visual Analytics solution for improving teaching strategies and course designs at NorthClass.

### Key Data Preparation

Data preprocessing and cleaning is required at the initial phase to ensure usability and consistency of the data records for subsequent data analysis. Based on initial assessment of the datasets, the Key Data preparation steps required are as follows.

-   Remove duplicates, handle missing values through imputation or deletion, and correct inconsistencies.
-   Correcting data type and addressing outliers
-   Create new relevant attributes if needed.
-   Merging of Multiple datasets in Dataset 3 in to a single continuous dataframe

### Key Data Viz

To address the aforesaid requirements, the following methodologies will be considered.

-   the analysis of answering behaviors involves identifying key performance metrics such as average scores, answer correctness, and time correlations to evaluate learners' understanding and application of knowledge. Descriptive statistics will be used to compute mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types. Correlation analysis will be applied to study the relationship between time taken to answer and correctness. Histograms and box plots could be used to visualize score distributions. Performance metrics could be caculated such as accuracy rate, average attempts per question, and time efficiency.
-   learning behavior patterns involve analyzing habitual actions. In preference analysis, time-series analysis will be used to identify peak answering times, analysing the frequency and performance of different question types by bar charts and pie charts to get the preferred question type. To cluster the learner group and segment profile, clustering algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can be used based on behavior patterns.
-   Furthermore, in modeling the relationship between learning modes and knowledge acquisition, basic analysis on feature selection, standardization, correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis will be conducted to define knowledge acquisition. Linear or logistic regression models can be used to predict knowledge acquisition based on learning modes. Integrate results from different models to enhance predictive accuracy and interpret the results to provide insights.
-   To identify difficulties based on learner knowledge levels, difficulty and knowledge levels will be categorized based on the historical performance data, and thresholds will be defined to filter data. Filter and analyze data to detect inappropriate questions that are too difficult or too easy based on learner performance.
-   Last but not least, based on the output, actionable recommendations will be provided, aiming to optimize the question bank, align difficulty levels with learners' abilities, and enhance the overall quality of teaching and learning.

Accordingly, the envisioned DataViz for this project will be as as follows.

-   Bar plot for mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types.
-   Bar plot for classifying answers into correct and incorrect categories.
-   Scatter plot for time vs. Correctness
-   Score distribution and performance metrics: Histogram for score distribution, bar plot for accuracy rate, ridgeline plot for Performance Metrics
-   Peaking hours analysis:
    -   Time line chart: Displays the number of activities at different time points in a day to help identify peak hours.
    -   Heat map: Displays the distribution of daily or weekly activities to help discover high-frequency activities in a specific time period.
-   Clustering result display:
    -   Radar chart: Displays multiple dimensional features of each cluster.
    -   Box plot: Displays the distribution of each cluster to understand the differences of clusters.
