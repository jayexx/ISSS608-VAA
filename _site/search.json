    "text": "Grammar of Graphics\nBefore getting started using ggplot2, it is important to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson in 1999 Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will provide insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may provide guidance on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there could still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\nLayered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. There are 7 layers of grammar, aka Essential Grammatical Elements, described as follows.\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics: take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets: splits the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics: statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems: define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes: modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Data\nWith ggplot() a blank canvas for the data visualisation can be first intialised, as shown in the following code chunk.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Aesthetics mappings\nAesthetic mappings utilises attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (each geom layer can have its own aes specification)\nThe code chunk below illustrates the use of aes() to add a simple aesthetic element (the x axis and label) into the plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Geometrics\nGeometric objects are the centerpiece graphical marks placed on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\nGeometric object: Bar charts\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than auto-assignment, the bin width could also be specified.\nSince each dot represents 1 observation, the y-axis is not meaningful and becomes misleading instead.\nTo address the above, the code chunk specifies the bin width, and also removes the y-axis using scale_y_continuous().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Histograms\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object modification: geom()\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object modification: aes()\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually. The code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Violin Plot\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: Points\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric object: combination\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Statistics\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\nStat function: stat_summary()\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nMean values can be depicted by a red dot, using stat_summary() and overriding the default geom(), to address the above with the following code chunk.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun =\"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat function: using geom()\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun.y=\"mean\",           \n             colour =\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\nWarning in geom_point(stat = \"summary\", fun.y = \"mean\", colour = \"red\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `fun.y`\n\n\nNo summary function supplied, defaulting to `mean_se()`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat function: geom_smooth() to plot best fit curve\nThe interpretability of the scatterplot showing the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Facets\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\nFacet functions: facet_wrap()\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet functions: facet_grid()\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Coordinate systems\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\nCoordinates function: coord_flip()\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinates function: coord_cartesian()\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGPlot2 Essential Grammatical Elements: Themes\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\n\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()"

Noting that there are valid values such as dates that also contain “-” and multibyte values such as ENCHANTe~ in the project name col, the code uses regex to filter for “-” values instead.\ncolSums()

is done using a box plot to identify the existence of outliers in both dependent variables - (1) No. of Units and (2) Unit Price (PSF) as follows.\n\nNo. of units\n\n\nRealis 2024 Q1 datasetRealis

1% of the units that belonged to multiple-unit transactions.\n\nUnit Price (PSF)\n\n\nRealis 2024 Q1 datasetRealis merged dataset\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot the box plot\nggplot(data = Realis24Q1, aes(x =

sizable number trailing out from the right tail of the box plot.\n\n\n\nData Transformation\nBased on the findings above, the significance of each variable, the conclusions drawn and transformations required are summarised as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS/N\nVariable\nData Type\nDescription\nRemarks\n\n\n\n1\nProject Name\nchr\nPrivate Residential Development Project Name\nNo missing values suggests that all property transactions in the data set belong to a private project development\n\n\n\n2\nTransacted Price ($)\nnum\nTransacted Property Sale Price\nSince price is already known to be strongly correlated to Area, Unit Price (aka Price per Area) will potentially provide greater insights to multiple stakeholders.\n\n\n\n3\nArea (SQFT)\nnum\nProperty Floor Area (aka Unit Size) in SQFT\nSince price is already known to be strongly correlated to Area, Unit Price (aka Price per Area) will potentially provide greater insights to multiple stakeholders.\n\n\n\n4\nUnit Price ($ PSF)\nnum\nSale Price per Floor Area in SQFT\nPSF is chosen over PSM as a indicator for Price per area as a dependent variable for Data Visualisation 3.\n\n\n\n5\nSale Date\nchr\nDate of Sales Transaction\nSale date will be required for Data Visualisation 2 to provide granularity on time-wise trends across the quarters.\nData type will need to be changed to Date instead of chr.\n\n\n\n6\nAddress\nchr\nDetailed line of address\nAddress is closely related to other geographical variables, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n7\nType of Sale\nchr\nDifferentiates between\n\nsales of a new property (directly from the developer)\nsecondhand sales of unbuilt property (aka subsale)\nresale of existing property\n\nType of sale will be a property classification and potential interacting variable that will be used in Data Visualisation 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n\n8\nType of Area\nchr\nDifferentiates whether the land under the property is:\n\nshared in a development project (strata)\nsolely owned by the property owner\n\nType of Area is closely related to property type, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n9\nArea (SQM)\nnum\nProperty Floor Area (aka Unit Size) in SQM\nSince price is already known to be strongly correlated to Area, Price per Area will potentially provide greater insights to multiple stakeholders.\n\n\n\n10\nUnit Price ($ PSM)\nnum\nSale Price per Floor Area in SQM\nPSF is chosen over PSM as a indicator for Price per area as a dependent variable for Data visualisation 3.\n\n\n\n11\nNett Price($)\nchr\nPrice taking away officially recorded discounts and grants by URA\nMissing Values found for this variable in majority of rows, and since it has a similar purpose as transaction price, the latter will be used instead.\n\n\n\n12\nProperty Type\nchr\nDifferentiates the property type into:\n\nCondominium\nTerrace\nSemi-detached\nDetached\n\nProperty Type will be a property classification and potential interacting variable that will be used in Data Visualisation 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n\n13\nNumber of Units\nnum\nNumber of units sold in the single transaction\nNumber of units is chosen as the dependent variable for Data Visualisation 1 and 2 to explore the distribution of unit sales by property classifications.\nTo minimise complexity in the visualisation, the multiple-unit transactions which constitutes a small minority of the data, will be filtered away as outliers, which could be revisited in a future study.\n\n\n\n14\nTenure\nchr\nTenure period granted to the property owner over the land starting from the date of completion\nTenure will be a property classification and potential interacting variable that will be used in Data Visualisation 1, 2 and 3\nTo contain the wide variation in representations, the values will be binned such that all lease years less than 900 years will be classified as “Leasehold”, while values above will be classified as “999years/Freehold”\n\n\n\n15\nCompletion Date\nchr\nYear when the first building project is deemed completed upon grant of the tenure of the land.\nThe age of the property can be derived from this variable which will be a property classification and potential interacting variable that will be used in Data Visualisation 1, 2 and 3, however, missing values were found for this variable in a small minority of rows.\nHence data transformation is required to remove rows with missing values, derive property age with 2024 as a reference point, and replace “Uncompleted” properties as 0 in age.\n\n\n\n16\nPurchaser Address Indicator\nchr\nType of residence of the purchaser’s address which he/she need not necessarily own\nThis could be a variable to determine if the purchaser is upgrading, downgrading or perhaps buying a 2nd property, but since there isn’t enough info on whether the buyer is actually selling their current property, significant assumptions need to be made.\n\n\n\n17\nPostal Code\nchr\nGeographical code which is unique to the building address of transacted property\nPostal Code is closely related to other geographical variables, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n18\nPostal District\nchr\nGeographical code which is unique to the postal district of transacted property, total of 28 districts in Singapore\nPostal District is closely related to other geographical variables, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n19\nPostal Sector\nchr\nGeographical code unique to postal sector of transacted property, which is a sub area of district, total of 81 sectors in Singapore\nPostal Sector is closely related to other geographical variables, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n20\nPlanning Region\nchr\nGeographical region of transacted property, total of 5 regions - Central, North, North East, East and West.\nPlanning Region is the least complex amongst the geographical variables, and hence is selected as an ideal property classification and potential interacting variable that will be used in Data Visualisation 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n\n21\nPlanning Area\nchr\nName of geographical area of transacted property, total of 55 areas in Singapore\nPlanning Area is closely related to other geographical variables, but is not selected as the preferred variable to be used in this study.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above, the data transformations required in preparation for the Data Visualisation is done and subsequently inspected using glimpse() in the following code chunk.\n\n\nCode\n# For version control, start by

This suggests that the PSF for private property sales transaction had maintained fairly consistent over the 5 quarters, with some slight deviation.\nFor Property age, all quarters displayed a right skew in the distribution of sales, with the peaks notably aligned close to 0. This suggests that across the 5 quarters, preferences for newer properties also maintained as a consistent trend.\n\nOn the other hand, there were notable differences for sales distribution over time, where by peaks were observed at random parts of each of the 5 quarters. A closer look at the timing of the peaks and comparing with external data sources, it is found that these peaks in fact align with the 1st 2 weekends of new project launches. Rather than seasonal, the trend in sales peaks are most significantly driven by new project launches."

While the observed for executive condominium is within expectation, since it did afterall start out at a cheaper price as part of the governments efforts to meet the masstige market needs, the observations for the rest bring an interesting insight, and is worth exploring further beyond this study.\nFor Planning Region, interestingly, the rankings are exactly the same as that of the unit sales, which supports the possibility that this ranking could perhaps be indicative of the a strong preference for location of private properties among buyers in the first quarter of 2024.\nFor Tenure, the observation brings no surprise that 999yrs/freehold is more expensive in Unit Price as compared to leasehold, which is opposite of the rankings for unit sales.\nFor Property Age, the scatter plot and smoothened curve seems to suggest that there is at most a weak linearity relationship between property age and unit Price.\nFor Transacted prices, the scatter plot and smoothened curve similarly seems to suggest that there is at most a weak linearity relationship between Transacted prices and unit Price."

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements. Onclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked. Data_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements. If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\ntwo steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\ntooltip can be customised further to include a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\nby using plot_ly(), and by using ggplotly()\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE)\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive:\nClick on the colour symbol at the legend.\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data. two scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions. lastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)d &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData. Visit this link to learn more about crosstalk\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown above.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)      \n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!."

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\nTip Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above read_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet. mutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor. mutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer. Unfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_()/exit_() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year). ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\nTip Before you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\nThe Schwarz criterion/BIC is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "Recommended Makeover\nTo address the aforesaid critique, the following alternatives are suggested\n\n1. Reassess outliers and Re-clean Data\nThis is meant to address issues #1 and potentially #2 and #7, by choosing 1 of the following options:\n(a) Exclude all multiple-unit transactions as outliers,\n(b) Use PSF instead of Transacted Price, or\n(c) Derive a new variable Price per unit by dividing the variable ‘Transacted price ($)’ by the variable ‘Number of Units’\nTo consider if it is meaningful for option (a), a uni-variate analysis on number of units is first done in the following code chunk.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate frequency counts for each value of \"Number of Units\"\nfreq_counts &lt;- Realis_Q1merged %&gt;%\n  count(`Number of Units`)\n\n# Plot the histogram and Display frequency counts as text\nggplot(data = Realis_Q1merged, aes(x = `Number of Units`)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_text(data = freq_counts, aes(label = n, y = n), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Units\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the following code chunk, the Project Names for the multiple-unit transactions are extracted.\n\nsubset_df &lt;- subset(Realis_Q1merged, `Number of Units` &gt; 1, select = c(\"Project Name\", \"Number of Units\"))\nsubset_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  `Project Name`         `Number of Units`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 CLAYMORE PLAZA                         2\n2 BAGNALL COURT                         43\n3 MONDO MANSION BUILDING                 4\n4 MEYER PARK                            60\n5 N.A.                                   3\n\n\nBased on the above, it is found that out of 9.6k rows, only 5 rows contain multiple-unit transaction. For which, Bagnall court and Meyer Park were found to be en bloc sales, and including the rest, amounts to slightly over just 1% of the total units transacted. Hence it seems reasonable to exclude these data points in lieu that there could be different factors affecting the transaction prices and hence will need to be explored separately instead. The data cleaning is hence done in the following code chunk\n\n# Filter out the multiple-unit transactions as outliers\nRealis_Q1merged &lt;- Realis_Q1merged %&gt;% filter(`Number of Units` &lt;= 1)\n\n\n\n2. Synchronise box plots’ axes, visualise same category side by side and enable zoom into box plot to compare summary stats\nThis is meant to address issues #2, #3, #4, #6 & #7, by employing 1 of the following options in the DataViz makeover:\n(a) facet_grid or facet_wrap\n(b) Coordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph\n(c) Interactive Box plot with ggplotly()\nGoing with (c) as potentially the simplest option, a revised DataViz with Coordinated Multiple views with ggplotly() is plotted with the following code chunk.\n\n# Convert transacted price to millions\nRealis_Q1merged &lt;- Realis_Q1merged %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Transacted Price ($ Million)` = `Transacted Price ($)` / 1e6)\n\n# Define the order of combined factor\nRealis_Q1merged$Type_Quarter &lt;- factor(paste(Realis_Q1merged$`Type of Sale`, Realis_Q1merged$Quarter), \n                                       levels = c(\"New Sale 2023Q1\", \"New Sale 2024Q1\", \"Resale 2023Q1\", \"Resale 2024Q1\", \"Sub Sale 2023Q1\", \"Sub Sale 2024Q1\"))\n\n# Create box plots for each combination of Type of Sale and Quarter\np &lt;- ggplot(data = Realis_Q1merged, aes(x = Type_Quarter, y = `Transacted Price ($ Million)`, fill = factor(Quarter))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Type of Sale and Quarter\", y = \"Transacted Price ($ Million)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Box Plot of Transacted Price by Type of Sale and Quarter\") +\n  coord_flip() + # Rotate the plot horizontally\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"M\"), breaks = seq(0, max(Realis_Q1merged$`Transacted Price ($ Million)`), by = 2)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Convert ggplot object to plotly\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the revised DataViz above, side-by-side comparison can now be done, with the box plot color fill differentiating between 2023Q1 and 2024Q1. And to further address the compressed box plot due to the long tail of outliers, the interactive ggplotly() function allows zooming in. Furthermore, the axes are flipped with x-axis tick intervals (for transaction prices) adjusted to $2 million, along with the addition of data labels for the median, IQR, min and max. These significantly enhances the visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics for the differences between the Sales Type between Q1 of 2023 and 2024.\n\n\n3. Clearer indication of skewness of distribution and removal of tick marks for categorial variable\nThis is meant to address the remaining issues #5 & #8, by employing 1 of the following options in the DataViz makeover:\n(a) display mean as a red dot on box plot\n(b) use violin plot with median and mean\n(c) two sample mean test using gg between stats\nGoing with (a) as the simplest option, a revised DataViz to add the indication of the mean and clean up the plot by removing the tick marks for categorical variable is plotted with the following code chunk.\n\n# Create box plots for each combination of Type of Sale and Quarter\np &lt;- ggplot(data = Realis_Q1merged, aes(x = Type_Quarter, y = `Transacted Price ($ Million)`, fill = factor(Quarter))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 20, size = 1.5, color = \"blue\",\n               position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +\n  labs(x = \"Type of Sale and Quarter\", y = \"Transacted Price ($ Million)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Box Plot of Transacted Price by Type of Sale and Quarter\") +\n  coord_flip() + # Rotate the plot horizontally\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"M\"), breaks = seq(0, max(Realis_Q1merged$`Transacted Price ($ Million)`), by = 2)) +\n  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Convert ggplot object to plotly\nggplotly(p, tooltip = c(\"y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the latest version of the DataViz makeover above, the mean is illustrated with the red circle, and the value can also be read from the tooltip upon mouse over the point. With the mean, the skewness of the plot can be determined based on whether the mean is smaller than (left skew) larger than (right skew) or equal (centralized) to the median. Last but not least, the tick marks for the categorical variable which is unnecessary has also been removed.\nConverting to an interactive violin plot further enables the distribution to be visualised and compared, while keeping the labels for the mean and median as red and black circles respectively, however the code would increase in complexity significantly to still include the quartile, as see in the code chunk below.\n\n# Create violin plots for each combination of Type of Sale and Quarter\np &lt;- ggplot(data = Realis_Q1merged, aes(x = Type_Quarter, y = `Transacted Price ($ Million)`, fill = factor(Quarter))) +\n  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.7, width = 0.8) + # Adjust width of violins\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 20, size = 1.5, color = \"blue\",\n               position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), aes(label = paste(\"Mean Transaction Price = \", round(..y.., 2))), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun = median, geom = \"point\", shape = 20, size = 1.5, color = \"black\",\n               position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), aes(label = paste(\"Median Transaction Price = \", round(..y.., 2))), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun = function(x) quantile(x, 0.25), geom = \"segment\", aes(x = Type_Quarter, xend = Type_Quarter, yend = ..y..), position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), color = \"blue\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  stat_summary(fun = function(x) quantile(x, 0.75), geom = \"segment\", aes(x = Type_Quarter, xend = Type_Quarter, yend = ..y..), position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), color = \"blue\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Type of Sale and Quarter\", y = \"Transacted Price ($ Million)\", fill = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plot of Transacted Price by Type of Sale and Quarter\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"M\"), breaks = seq(0, max(Realis_Q1merged$`Transacted Price ($ Million)`), by = 2),\n                     limits = c(0, max(Realis_Q1merged$`Transacted Price ($ Million)`))) +\n  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Convert ggplot object to plotly\nggplotly(p, tooltip = c(\"y\"))"

The package provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, the following 2 articles should be read:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\niris_tree &lt;- iris_tree %&gt;%\n  activate(nodes) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Species = ifelse(leaf, as.character(iris$Species)[label], NA)) %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  mutate(to_setose = .N()$Species[to] == 'setosa')\niris_tree\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data.

Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden). The ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\n\n\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses theme() to change the position of the legend.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds frame to each graph.\n\nset_graph_style() \n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunkc below, facet_nodes() is used.

There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to Chapter 7: Actor Prominence of A User’s Guide to Network Analysis in R to gain better understanding of theses network measures.\n\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,\n            size=betweenness_centrality))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\nmutate() of dplyr is used to perform the computation. the algorithm used, on the other hand, is the centrality_betweenness() of tidygraph.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that from ggraph v2.0 onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.\n\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = centrality_betweenness()))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness), Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy), Louvain (group_louvain), Walktrap (group_walktrap), Label propagation (group_label_prop), InfoMAP (group_infomap), Spinglass (group_spinglass), and Optimal (group_optimal). Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it.

    "text": "This section, will cover how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. The package provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, the following 2 articles should be read:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\niris_tree &lt;- iris_tree %&gt;%\n  activate(nodes) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Species = ifelse(leaf, as.character(iris$Species)[label], NA)) %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  mutate(to_setose = .N()$Species[to] == 'setosa')\niris_tree\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday   Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 Saturday      13\n 2    41    43 Monday        11\n 3    35    31 Tuesday       10\n 4    40    41 Monday        10\n 5    40    43 Monday        10\n 6    36    32 Sunday         9\n 7    40    43 Saturday       9\n 8    41    40 Monday         9\n 9    19    15 Wednesday      8\n10    35    38 Tuesday        8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows"

Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes.

The ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl.

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nOur methodology systematically integrates data collection, data processing, analysis, pattern mining, modeling, and recommendations to create a comprehensive Visual Analytics solution for improving teaching strategies and course designs at NorthClass Institute, elaborated below.\n\nKey Data Preparation\nData preprocessing and cleaning is required at the initial phase to ensure usability and consistency of the data records for subsequent data analysis. Based on initial assessment of the datasets, the Key Data preparation steps required are as follows.\n\nRemove duplicates, handle missing values through imputation or deletion, and correct inconsistencies.\nCorrecting data type and addressing out-liers.\nCreate new relevant attributes if needed.\nMerging of Multiple datasets in Dataset 3 into a single continuous dataframe, and subsequently joining Datasets 1 and 2 with 3.\n\n\n\nKey DataViz\nTo address the aforesaid requirements, the following methodologies will be considered for the data visualisation (DataViz).\n\nFor task 1, the analysis of answering behaviors involves identifying key performance metrics such as average scores, answer correctness, and time correlations to evaluate learners’ understanding and application of knowledge. Descriptive statistics will be used to compute mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types. Histograms, violin and box plots could be used to visualize score distributions. Performance metrics could be calculated such as accuracy rate, average attempts per question, and time efficiency. These statistical analysis and visualisations will be done in tandem with the classification of questions, to finally visualise and quantify mastery and weaknesses in the various knowledge areas.\nFor task 2, learning behavior patterns involve analyzing habitual actions. Time-series analysis will be used to identify peak answering times. And by studying the frequency and performance of different question types with bar charts, the preferred question type can also be identified. To profile and segment the learner groups, clustering analysis algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can be used based on features engineered from the aforementioned behavior patterns and preferences.\nFor task 3, in modeling the relationship between knowledge acquisition and learning modes, feature selection may build upon analysis from task 1 for knowledge acquisition and task 2 for learning modes. Correlation and Association analysis can then be used to ascertain the statistical significance of the relationships if any.\nFor task 4, to identify question difficulty and learner knowledge levels, questions and learners can be ranked and categorized based on the historical performance data, and thresholds can be defined to sort and bin the data into levels. Cross-comparison can thus be done to filter and analyze data to detect inappropriate questions that are too difficult based on learner performance. An alternative group of inappropriate questions can also be suggested through visualising questions that ‘weak’ learners scored better and/or questions that ‘strong’ learners scored worse.\nLast but not least for task 5, based on the insights gleaned, actionable recommendations will be derived, (such as optimizing the question bank, customizing knowledge delivery based on learning patterns and preferences) aiming to enhance the overall quality of teaching and learning.\n\nAccordingly, a summary of the envisioned DataViz for this project will be as as follows.\n\nGeneral Analysis (for Task 1):\n\nBar plot for mean, median, and mode of scores for different topics and question types.\nBar plot for classifying answers into correct and incorrect categories.\nScatter plot for time vs. Correctness\nFacet plots to visualise multiple plots in a single space\n\nScore distribution and performance metrics (for Tasks 1 & 4): \n\nHistogram for score distribution, bar plot for accuracy rate\nFacet, Ridgeline or Raindrop plots for performance metrics and to compare distribution for various categories\n\nPeaking hours analysis (for Task 2):\n\nTime line chart: Displays the number of activities at different time points in a day to help identify peak hours.\nHeat map: Displays the distribution of daily or weekly activities to help discover high-frequency activities in a specific time period.\n\nClustering result display (for Task 2 & 3):\n\nRadar chart: Displays multiple dimensional features of each cluster.\nBox plot: Displays the distribution of each cluster to understand the differences of clusters.\n\nAssociation and Correlation Analysis (for Task 3 & 4):\n\nScatter plot with best-fit line/curve and shaded area for significance level using ggscaterstats for single numerical independent variable and dependent variable\nMultiple Violin plots using ggbetweenstats for multiple categorical independent variables and numerical independent variable"
