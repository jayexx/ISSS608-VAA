## Overview

The key learning objective of this hands-on exercise is to plot functional and truthful choropleth maps using appropriate R packages.

## Getting Started

The code chunk below installs and loads various required packages into R environment

```{r}
pacman:: p_load(scatterPlotMatrix, parallelPlot, cluster, factoextra, tidyverse)
```

## Importing Data

```{R}
wine <- read_csv("data/wine_quality.csv")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = wine,
       aes(x = type)) +
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
whitewine <- wine %>%
  filter(type == "white") %>%
  select(c(1:11))
```

```{r}
scatterPlotMatrix(whitewine, 
                  corrPlotType = "Text",
                  distribType = 1,
                  rotateTitle = TRUE,
                  width = 900,
                  height = 900
                  )
```
