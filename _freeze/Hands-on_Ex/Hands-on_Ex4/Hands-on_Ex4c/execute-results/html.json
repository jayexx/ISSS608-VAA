They are:\n\n- readr for importing csv into R.\n- FunnelPlotR for creating funnel plot.\n- ggplot2 for creating funnel plot manually.\n- knitr for building static html table.\n- plotly for creating interactive funnel plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Importing data\n\nIn this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal. For this hands-on exercise, we are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.\n\nThe code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called covid19.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid19 <- read_csv(\"data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv\") %>%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## FunnelPlotR methods\n\nFunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are:\n\nlimit: plot limits (95 or 99).\nlabel_outliers: to label outliers (true or false).\nPoisson_limits: to add Poisson limits to the plot.\nOD_adjust: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.\nxrange and yrange: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.\nOther aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.\n\n### FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot\n\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Positive,\n  denominator = Death,\n  group = `Sub-district`\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex4c_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\n- group in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If City is chosen, there are only six data points.\n- By default, data_typeargument is “SR”.\n- limit: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.\n\n### FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1\n\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,  \n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",     #<<\n  x_range = c(0, 6500),  #<<\n  y_range = c(0, 0.05)   #<<\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex4c_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above. + data_type argument is used to change from default “SR” to “PR” (i.e. proportions). + xrange and yrange are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis\n\n###  FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2\n\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,  \n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",   \n  x_range = c(0, 6500),  \n  y_range = c(0, 0.05),\n  label = NA,\n  title = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #<<           \n  x_label = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #<<\n  y_label = \"Cumulative Fatality Rate\"  #<<\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex4c_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\n- label = NA argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.\n- title argument is used to add plot title.\n- x_label and y_label arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.\n\n## Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods\n\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\n## References\n",
