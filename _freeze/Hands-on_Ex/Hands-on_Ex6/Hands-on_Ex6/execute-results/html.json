They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these 4 packages, tidyverse and lubridate, specially designed to handle and wrangle time data, will be installed and launched too.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Data\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n### Importing network data from files\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_nodes <- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\nGAStech_edges <- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### The edges data\n\nGAStech-email_edges.csv which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      <dbl> 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      <dbl> 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    <chr> \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    <time> 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     <chr> \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject <chr> \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel <chr> \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel <chr> \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### The nodes data\n\nGAStech_email_nodes.csv which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(GAStech_nodes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 54\nColumns: 4\n$ id         <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 44, 45, 46, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, …\n$ label      <chr> \"Mat.Bramar\", \"Anda.Ribera\", \"Rachel.Pantanal\", \"Linda.Lago…\n$ Department <chr> \"Administration\", \"Administration\", \"Administration\", \"Admi…\n$ Title      <chr> \"Assistant to CEO\", \"Assistant to CFO\", \"Assistant to CIO\",…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Warning\"}\nThe output report of GAStech_edges above reveals that the SentDate is treated as \"Character\" data type instead of date data type.

The package provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\nBefore getting started, the following 2 articles should be read:\n\n-   [Introducing tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)\n-   [tidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope](https://www.data-imaginist.com/posts/2018-02-12-tidygraph-1-1-a-tidy-hope/index.html)\n\n### The tbl_graph object\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\n-   tbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\n\n-   as_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\n-   a node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\n\n-   data.frame, list, matrix from base,\n\n-   igraph from igraph,\n\n-   network from network,\n\n-   dendrogram and hclust from stats,\n\n-   Node from data.tree,\n\n-   phylo and evonet from ape, and\n\n-   graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n### The dplyr verbs in tidygraph\n\n-   activate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n```         \niris_tree <- iris_tree %>%\n  activate(nodes) %>%\n  mutate(Species = ifelse(leaf, as.character(iris$Species)[label], NA)) %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  mutate(to_setose = .N()$Species[to] == 'setosa')\niris_tree\n```\n\n-   In the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n### Using tbl_graph() to build tidygraph data model.\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph's network graph data.frame.\n\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Reviewing the output tidygraph's graph object\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   <dbl> <chr>               <chr>          <chr>                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>    <int>\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Reviewing the output tidygraph's graph object\n\n-   The output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\n-   The command also prints the first six rows of \"Node Data\" and the first three of \"Edge Data\".\n-   It states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n### Changing the active object\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest \"weight\" first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\n\nFor example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday   Weight\n   <int> <int> <ord>      <int>\n 1    40    41 Saturday      13\n 2    41    43 Monday        11\n 3    35    31 Tuesday       10\n 4    40    41 Monday        10\n 5    40    43 Monday        10\n 6    36    32 Sunday         9\n 7    40    43 Saturday       9\n 8    41    40 Monday         9\n 9    19    15 Wednesday      8\n10    35    38 Tuesday        8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  <dbl> <chr>           <chr>          <chr>           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plotting Static network graphs using ggraph\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\n\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph's network graph, they are:\n\n-   nodes,\n-   edges and\n-   layouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n### Plotting a basic network graph\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph.
