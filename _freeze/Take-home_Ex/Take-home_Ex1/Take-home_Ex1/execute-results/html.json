Public housing aims to meet the basic need of the general public with monthly household income less than or equal to S$14,000. For families with monthly household income more than S$14,000, they need to turn to the private residential market.\n\n\n\n## Objectives\n\nAssuming the role of a graphical editor of a median company, you are requested to prepare minimum two and maximum three data visualisation to reveal the private residential market and sub-markets of Singapore for the 1st quarter of 2024.\n\nThe write-up of the take-home exercise should include but not limited to the followings:\n\nA reproducible description of the procedures used to prepare the analytical visualisation. Please refer to the senior submission I shared below.\n\nA write-up of not more than 150 words per each data visualisation, describing and discussing the patterns and/or trends reveal by each visualisation prepared.\n\nThe key objectives of this exercise are:\n\n-   To perform geovisualisation and analysis of Origin-Destination flows of passenger trips\n-   To perform Spatial Interaction Modelling for Origin-Destination flows of passenger trips\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe code chunk below load the following libraries:\n\n-   tidyverse: an amalgamation of libraries for data handling (including readr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2)\n-   knitr: for creating html table\n-   reshape2: for reshaping functions\n-   stplanr:\n-   spdep:\n-   sfdep: for creating an sf and tidyverse friendly interface as well as for introducing new functionality that is not present in spdep\n-   plotly: for interactive plots\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tmap, sf, sp, tidyverse, knitr,  reshape2, stplanr, performance, DT, ggpubr) \n```\n:::",
